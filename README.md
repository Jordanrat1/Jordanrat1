I'm a Senior Generative AI Strategist at AWS, where I help Fortune 500 companies design and implement generative AI solutions â€” from vision to deployment.

Over the last decade, Iâ€™ve built and led AI teams, shaped products from zero to scale, and delivered real-world results with conversational AI, LLMs, and intelligent systems. I previously co-founded Deloitteâ€™s global AI practice and served as Managing Partner at OneReach.ai, leading enterprise deployments across industries.
